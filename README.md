###File Formats and How to Open Them

CSV (Comma-Separated Value)
* What: A tabular (spreadsheet) data format, where the column values are separated by commas. CSV files are both human and machine readable. 
* How: Many applications, including Microsoft Excel, [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/), and [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com) and by text editors like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), Apple TextEdit, and Microsoft Notepad.

JPEG

* How:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
* What: JSON is an easily human and machine readable open standard format, which transmits data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs. [GeoJSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is an extension of JSON that allows for the encoding of simple geographical features (points, lines and polygons) along with non-spatial attributes. [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki) itself extends GeoJSON by "stiching" together shared geometries (e.g. borders). This reduces file size and also facilitates certain visualizations.
* How: GeoJSON files can be opened by desktop mapping applications such as [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/), and [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/), by web-mapping tools such as GeoJSON.io and CartoDB, by RStudio, and by text editors.

KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
* What:
* How:

PNG
* What:
* How:

SHP (ESRI Shapefile)
* What: Shapefiles are one of the most common geospatial formats out there. Like GeoJSON, shapefiles can store both spatial geometries (points, lines and polygons) and other feature attributes. 
* How: In addition to ArcGIS, these files can be opened in free an open source GIS applications like QGIS. They can also be converted to many other data formats. The online utility [ogr2ogr](http://ogre.adc4gis.com/) supports conversion from SHP and other file formats into GeoJSON.

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
* What: TIFF is a computer file format used to store [raster graphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) images, which are made up of usually rectangular grids of pixels. In our data catalog, TIFFs are used for geographic images (e.g. satellite imagery or [heat maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map)). These TIFFs include georeferencing information (or metadata) that allow you to project them onto a map and are referred to as GeoTIFFs.
* How: TIFFs can be opened in image viewers, like Apple Preview. In the case of GeoTIFFs, you might find it useful to use GIS software, such as QGIS.

TopoJSON

TXT (Plain Text)
