###File Formats

CSV (Comma-Separated Value) • A tabular (spreadsheet) data format, where the column values are separated by commas. CSV files are both human and machine readable. They can be opened in many applications, including Excel, OpenOffice and Google Docs.

GeoJSON • JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation) is an easily human and machine readable open standard format, which transmits data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs. GeoJSON is an extension of JSON that allows for the encoding of simple geographical features (points, lines and polygons) along with non-spatial attributes. GeoJSON files can be opened by desktop applications such as TileMill, QGIS, ArcGIS, and RStudio. In addition, they can be visualized with online tools such as GeoJSON.io, GitHub, and Gist.

GeoTIFF • 

JPEG • 

KML • 

PNG • 

SHP (ESRI Shapefile) • Shapefiles are one of the most common geospatial formats out there. Like GeoJSON, shapefiles can store both spatial geometries (points, lines and polygons) and other feature attributes. In addition to ArcGIS, these files can be opened in free an open source GIS applications like QGIS. They can also be converted to many other data formats. The online utility OGRE supports conversion from SHP and other file formats into GeoJSON.
